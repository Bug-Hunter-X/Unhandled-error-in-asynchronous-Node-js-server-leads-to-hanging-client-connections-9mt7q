# Unhandled Asynchronous Error in Node.js Server

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js servers where errors within asynchronous operations are not properly handled, resulting in hanging client connections. The server logs the error, but fails to send a response to the client, leading to a poor user experience.

## Bug Description

The provided `bug.js` file contains a simple HTTP server that simulates an asynchronous operation which may throw an error.  If the error occurs, the server logs the error, however, no response is sent back to the client. This causes the client to wait indefinitely until the connection times out.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the server. It uses a `try...catch` block within the asynchronous operation to gracefully handle potential errors and send an appropriate error response to the client, preventing hanging connections.  It also ensures a response is sent even if the asynchronous operation is successful.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `node bug.js`
3. Make a request to `http://localhost:3000`. Observe that if an error occurs, the client will hang.
4. Run `node bugSolution.js`
5. Make a request to `http://localhost:3000`. Observe that the server now sends an error response in case of failure and a success response otherwise.
